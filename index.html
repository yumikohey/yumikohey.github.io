							ABOUT ME
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p>
								I started an ecommerce business in late 2007, which led me fall in love with web development. Back then, I developed Wordpress and BigCommerce Templates just for fun. 
								<br>
								<br>
								During college, in order to develop business, I self-taught Internet Marketing. Two years ago, I started trading options, and I applied what I have learned about Internet Marketing. I shared trading diaries and technical analysis strategies on Chinese Sina Weibo. I not only attracted a lot of followers, but also got offer from Sina Weibo to become its Finance Columist. However, I turned it down, because I want to develop my career in web development industry in the United States.
								<br>
								<br>
								Technology has grown so fast. Wordpress is a fantastic platform yet I believe that using Ruby on Rails or Meteor.js to build a web application is much more efficient than building a Wordpress theme. Thus, as an Amazon Business Specialist managed $4 Million monthly transactions, I decided to leave my job for a programing bootcamp to continue developing my interests.
								<br>
								<br>
								So, here I am.

							So, whenever I have an interview, one of the interview questions is "What if one of your teamates doesn't do his/her work?" I guess, this is one of the reasons raises a conflict. My answer to the question is, if this is a team project, I will do his/her work. I don't mind to do double work, because I can learn more and develop more experience.

I remember that I read an article previously, where states that writing command lines can open hundreds of folders within several minutes, while mice cannot accomplish such tasks. It's the power of command line.

I love to see other classmates comments and opinions on Google+ community, and I am looking forward to pair coding with them.
