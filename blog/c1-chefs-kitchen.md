First week of Phrase 0 @ DBC

Date: 11/22

I am so excited about this program, because I am looking forward to see the brand new chapter in my life. During the first week, I have more chances to work on projects with use of GitHub and Google+, which I barely use when I work as individual. I pretty enjoy it. I love to see other classmates comments and opinions on Google+ community, and I am looking forward to pair coding with them.

I didn't feel nervous at all.
