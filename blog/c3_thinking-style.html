<p>One of the reasons that I pursue Web Development as my career is that I love building websites. Yet, as technology keep accelerately growing, we are required to build web applications, too. As Viktor E. Frankl helped a lot of WWII depressed patients, the approach he applied was "Search for meaning of your life." When I was a little, I've already questioned myself, how can I be a successful person? As I grown up, I don't really care about money. Especially living in the States, you don't need to worry so much that you may have nowhere to live or you may die because of starving or so. A person can be more focusing on "building and creating" things for society. However, due to the educational system in China, I was trained to be a person to follow rules, to follow what others do. The Chineses are less creative than other races, because we always be banned by our parents or our grandparents for our crazy ideas when we were little. As time flies, we become the people who just know how to study, how to take exams, because our parents say so. To be honest, I really hate it. However, I was under such educational system for more than 10 years. It's so difficult to train me to be a creative person, plus no mentor is around. Anyways, what I am trying to point out here is that I choose to become a developer rather than an UI or designer, because designers are required to be more creative. The other reason that I like to be a front-end developer rather than a back-end developer is that I can keep track what every single line I write is doing. Yet back-end required more abstract thinking, if I understand it right.</p>

<p>During the learning journey with DBC, I do couple pair programmings with our cohort mates. I really enjoy doing pair programmings. I also got inspired by Johnathan a lot. Even though he didin't have programing experience, he has computer science mind set. What do I mean by this? Every time I pair programing with him, he would try to solve the problem in several ways in order to get the concept completely. Every time I pair with him, he always do all the reading before he attends. However, me, on the other hand, I will feel so accomplished if I solve the problem. I won't think too much why as I can solve the problem. I don't even try to think whether there will be an easier way to solve this problem.</p>

<p>I have to grow up through this bootcamp. I need to change my mind set before I graduate from DBC.</p>
