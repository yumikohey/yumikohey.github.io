          	Before I joined DevBootcamp, I self-taught JavaScript, whenever I encounter difficulties, I really would like to get help from some experts. Thus, I went to Reddit for help, and a lot of nice people are willing to sharing their knowlegde with me.

            Then, DBC introduced me a concept of pair programing. I was very excited about it at first. Yet, I don't want to be forced to pair programing when I can finish the challenges by myself.

            I want to do all the challenges by myself first, if I've already thinked various ways and yet I still didn't get solutions for the challenge, I am very happy to open discuss with other cohort-mates.

            Sometimes, I received feedbacks from other cohort-mates, they said that I blew out answers too quick. If I gave them more time, they can have the same answers. It's really difficult for me to predict when my pair can get the answers. 

            Last time, I was doing GPS. Then, my guide said that I didn't go to Google search stuff. It's a little bit speechless comment. What happened was that my pair and I were confused about a concept, then, my pair said he was going to Google it. Thus, I searched on my end, (but I didn't say it). I don't think this can come out with comment that I don't Google. I really have no idea what the Guide was thinking when she wrote the feedback for me.

            My feedback for pair programming is that DBC should not mandatory students to have pair programming twice a week. Yet actually, students should have pair programming whenever they feel they need help. GPS is already a very great time for pair programing.
            I mean, I think pair programing is super helpful, but it's only helpful when I needed. I would love to help others, too, but I hope people can do enough research before they ask questions.

            Just like Stack Overview, they don't expect people ask duplicate questions, because they want everyone does enough research before he or she raises a question.
