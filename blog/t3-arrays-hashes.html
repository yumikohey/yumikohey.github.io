      <h1>Ruby Arrays vs Hashes</h1>
      <h4>Enumerable, max_by</h4>

    <p>
          From doing exercises this week, I learned that how to create a hash from an array. I think it will be pretty useful in the future pratices.

          '''ruby
              array = ["apple", "cat", "oranges", "rabbits"]
              new_hash = Hash.new
              array.each do |element|
                      new_hash[element] = element.length
              end
              new_hash
              #{"apple"=>5, "cat"=>3, "oranges"=>7, "rabbits"=>7}
          '''

          How simple is that? Right?
          Hope this example will help you.

          I also learned about Enumerable#max_by via doing the exercise.

          '''ruby
                  array = ["aaa", "a", "aa"]
                  array.max_by { |x| -x.length }
                  # => "a"

                  [].max_by { |x| -x.length }
                  # => nil
          '''

          Just two lines of code, you can get which is the longest words in an array. That is how powerful RUBY is. I remember when I was doing some JS practices before, I had to write at least ten lines of code to solve the problem.

          Hope this mini-blog post makes sense to you.
