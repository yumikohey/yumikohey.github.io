Git, version control, can help you work efficiently on Software development projects. Because we are limited by navigating via mice, yet writing command lines is infinite. I remember that I read an article previously, where states that writing command lines can open hundreds of folders within several minutes, while mice cannot accomplish such tasks. It's the power of command line.

Git not only can print out the changes of the repo, but also help you download changes from other contributors yet without conflicts with what you are working on.

I remember the first time i used GitHub, I was so impressive that GitHub shows the changes you made along the way. You can easily revert back or so. You can communicate with your teammates super easily.
