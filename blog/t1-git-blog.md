Challenge 1
1. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
	Since Command Line is not strange for me, I guess the most challenging one is alias command, because I didn't use it much.

2. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
	Yes. I used command lines before, so it is not a big problem for me.

3/ Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd
	print out the current path and directories

-ls
	list the files that contain in current folder

-grep
	-grep can find out the string within a file

-mv
	move a file into the folder that listed on the second instance.
	for instance, mv a b. which means move file a into b folder. 

-cd
	cd -- change directory. input cd will direct you out to the very beginning of the path

-../
	.. will move you out to the previous folder of the current one.

-touch
	create a blank file.

-mkdir
	make a folder/directory at the current folder

-echo
	echo will print out something on the screen

-less
	display the text inside a file, and need to type q to exit the program.

-rmdir
	remove a folder/directory at the current folder

-cat
	display text of a file

-rm
	remove a file in a folder 

-help
	help command will list the function that command line has

-exit
	will exit the program.



Challenge 2. Computer Set-Up 
	I've set up both my Windows and Macbook air before I joined the program. I also registered an account on Nitrous. As many people know that Windows is not friendly with Ruby on Rails. It helps me to work when I need a bigger monitor, =)


Challenge 3. Think about time

	Hmmm, this is a pretty pretty interesting topic. To be honest, I never spent any of my time in reading articles or books about time management. Not because I don't care about my time, but because I just don't believe in those system yet. 

	First, I think a lot of books that talking about time management is way too general and too vague. Second, even a person finish reading a time mangement book, he/she needs motivation and determination to execute the principles. Third, if someone has a clear picture of what his/her tasks, how important these tasks are, he/she will not be a procrastinator. For example, there is barely a person will miss his/her flight, because it's expensive and important. 

	And this challenge, maybe it's the first time that I spent on Time Management topic in my life. I did reserach on Time Boxing. Most people recommend that prioritize things to do on a day recently. Yea, that's pretty important. We have fresh and clear mind in the morning, we definitely should not waste on stupid things. Second, Time Boxing brings out an interesting topic. Set a time frame for a task. This is actually pretty new to me. I guess I can use it in the future.

Challenge 4 Git vs. GitHub

-   Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.
	
	Git is locally installed on your laptop. You can use git's function via terminal.
	GitHub is a hub on the internet, where developers can collaborate work together.

-   Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
	Version control is something that you need to type code in order to make it functionable on your laptop, while GitHub is the place for codes to be uploaded, to be downloaded, to be editable on live.

-   Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not? What doesn't make sense? What does?
	
	Yes. It makes sense to me. Developers use git, because developers do not need to navigate the site with mouse. Developers can simply edit and save and push their codes on TERMINAL. It helps developers efficiently do their work.

Setting up website on GitHub is not new to me, yet it's the first time I tried. I feel so cool to air a website under github.io subdomain.
