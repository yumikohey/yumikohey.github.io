Challenge 3. Think about time

	Hmmm, this is a pretty pretty interesting topic. To be honest, I never spent any of my time in reading articles or books about time management. Not because I don't care about my time, but because I just don't believe in those system yet. 

	First, I think a lot of books that talking about time management is way too general and too vague. Second, even a person finish reading a time mangement book, he/she needs motivation and determination to execute the principles. Third, if someone has a clear picture of what his/her tasks, how important these tasks are, he/she will not be a procrastinator. For example, there is barely a person will miss his/her flight, because it's expensive and important. 

	And this challenge, maybe it's the first time that I spent on Time Management topic in my life. I did reserach on Time Boxing. Most people recommend that prioritize things to do on a day recently. Yea, that's pretty important. We have fresh and clear mind in the morning, we definitely should not waste on stupid things. Second, Time Boxing brings out an interesting topic. Set a time frame for a task. This is actually pretty new to me. I guess I can use it in the future.
